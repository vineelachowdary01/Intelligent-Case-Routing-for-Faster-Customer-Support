In this phase, you successfully set up and configured your Salesforce Developer Org to support the Intelligent Case Routing project. You started by signing up for a Salesforce Developer Edition and logging into the Lightning Experience dashboard.

You created a New Lightning App (e.g., “Intelligent Case Routing App”) to serve as the workspace for your project. Inside the Object Manager, you created a custom object called Project Details, which stores key routing configuration information. You then added important fields such as Project Name, Routing Model, Status, SLA Target Hours, Start/End Dates, Priority, and Project Owner (lookup to User).

Next, you created a Custom Object Tab so the Project Details object can be accessed easily from the App Launcher and navigation bar. You configured profile-level visibility so that appropriate users (admins/managers) can view and manage this object.

Finally, you documented all steps with screenshots — including app creation, custom object creation, fields added, and tab creation — and uploaded them to your project repository, ensuring proper traceability and a README file explaining your Phase 2 work.
